Failure injection is a means of testing resiliency by which a specific failure type is simulated on a service and its response is assessed.

You have a choice of environments from which to execute the failure injections for this lab. Bash scripts are a good choice and can be used from a Linux command line. If you prefer Python, Java, Powershell, or C#, then instructions for these are also provided.

In addition to custom scripts, you can also perform failure injection experiments using [AWS Fault Injection Simulator (FIS)](https://aws.amazon.com/fis/).

### 2.1 Setup AWS CloudShell

If you will be using **bash**, **Java**, or **Python**, and are comfortable with Linux, it is highly recommended you use AWS CloudShell for this lab. If you will _not_ be using AWS CloudShell, then skip to [Step 2.2](#setupcreds)

{{% common/InitCloudShell region="us-east-2" %}}
1. Skip to [Step 2.3](#setupenv)


### 2.2 Setup AWS credentials and configuration {#setupcreds}

**If you have chosen to use AWS CloudShell or Windows PowerShell, then _skip_ this step** 

Otherwise, your execution environment needs to be configured to enable access to the AWS account you are using for the workshop. This includes:

* Credentials - You identified these credentials [back in step 1]({{< ref "./1_deploy_infra.md#awslogin" >}})
    * AWS access key
    * AWS secret access key
    * AWS session token (used in some cases)

* Configuration
    * Region: us-east-2
    * Default output: JSON

Note: **us-east-2** is the **Ohio** region

* If you already know how to configure these, please do so now.
* If you need help, then [follow these instructions]({{< ref "Documentation/AWS_Credentials.md" >}})
* If you are using **PowerShell** for this lab, skip this step and continue to **Step 2.3**


### 2.3 Set up the programming language environment {#setupenv}

Choose the appropriate section below for your language

Using bash is an effective way to execute the failure injection tests for this workshop. The bash scripts make use of the AWS CLI. Or if you wish, you may choose one of the other languages and scripts.

1. Prerequisites

     * `awscli` AWS CLI installed

            $ aws --version
            aws-cli/2.2.15 Python/3.8.8...
         * Version 2.1.12 or higher is fine
         * If you instead got `command not found` then [see instructions here to install `awscli`]({{< ref "Documentation/Software_Install.md#install-aws-cli" >}})

     * `jq` command-line JSON processor installed.

            $ jq --version

      * For Amazon Linux and RedHat

            $ sudo yum install maven

      * For Debian, Ubuntu

            $ sudo apt install maven

1. Next choose one of the following options: **Option A** or **Option B**. 
    * Note: If using **CloudShell** then choose **Option A**

    * **Option A**:
      1. Download the zipfile of the executable 
          ```bash
          $ wget https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/aws-well-architected-labs-ohio/Reliability/javaresiliency.zip
          ...
          2021-11-20 01:20:28 (43.1 MB/s) - ‘javaresiliency.zip’ saved [19825502/19825502]
          ```

      1. unzip it
          ```bash
          $ unzip javaresiliency.zip 
          Archive:  javaresiliency.zip
          ...
          inflating: java/app-resiliency-1.0.jar
          ```

      2. go to the build directory: `cd java/appresiliency`


    * **Option B**: If you are comfortable with git and are _not_ using CloudShell
      1. Clone the aws-well-architected-labs repo
          ```bash
          $ git clone https://github.com/awslabs/aws-well-architected-labs.git
          Cloning into 'aws-well-architected-labs'...
          ...
          Checking out files: 100% (1935/1935), done.
          ```

      2. go to the build directory
          ```bash
          cd aws-well-architected-labs/static/Reliability/300_Testing_for_Resiliency_of_EC2_RDS_and_S3/Code/FailureSimulations/java/appresiliency/
          ```

2. Build: `sudo mvn clean package shade:shade`    

3. `cd target` - this is where your `jar` files were built and where you can run from the command line


{{% /expand %}}
{{% expand "Click here for instructions if using C#:" %}}

1. Download the zipfile of the executable at the following URL. [https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/aws-well-architected-labs-ohio/Reliability/csharpresiliency.zip](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/aws-well-architected-labs-ohio/Reliability/csharpresiliency.zip)  

1. Unzip the folder in a location convenient for you to execute the command line program.  
    * The executable is called `AppResiliency.exe`
    * It is in the `win10-x64` folder
    * Later, when it is time to run you your experiments, you should run the executable from a Windows command prompt

1. Avoid potential credentials problems
    * Check to see if you have a file `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\AWSToolkit\RegisteredAccounts.json`
    * If so, then this file may override the AWS credentials you need to run the lab
    * You can rename it so that it does not interfere with the lab 

    ```
    move  %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\AWSToolkit\RegisteredAccounts.json %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\AWSToolkit\RegisteredAccounts-BAK.json
    ```

    * and then move it back if you want, after the lab

1. To view or download the source code, see [this github repo](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-well-architected-labs/tree/master/static/Reliability/300_Testing_for_Resiliency_of_EC2_RDS_and_S3/Code/FailureSimulations/c%23)

### 2.4 IAM Role for FIS

In this lab, some of the experiments will be executed AWS Fault Injection Simulator (FIS) in addition to using custom scripts. FIS needs a service role to inject failures for various components of a workload.

**This IAM Role has already been created for you as part of the infrastructure deployment**

You may proceed to the next step.

{{%expand "If you would like to view the instructions on how to create the IAM Role for FIS (for your information), then click here:" %}}
**These instructions are here for informational purposes only. You DO NOT need to execute these as this IAM Role was created for you as part of the infrastructure deployment**
