In this lab, you will use an EC2 autoscaling group with a Wordpress application, the Wordpress application is running on EC2 instances. To automate the deployment of this lab, Cloudformation templates are provided, it is important to follow the order of deployment and ensure that each template completes deployment successful before proceeding with the next template.

### 1.1 Setup the VPC Stack

In this step you will deploy the VPC.

Please download the latest version of the CloudFormation template here: [vpc-alb-app-db.yaml](/Common/Create_VPC_Stack/Code/vpc-alb-app-db.yaml) and setup the stack using the name **WebApp1-VPC**
or reference to [Create VPC Stack](/security/200_labs/200_automated_deployment_of_vpc/1_create_vpc_stack/)

Please ensure this template has succesfully completed deployment before proceeding to the next step, this will be noted by the stack status changing to **CREATE_COMPLETE**

### 1.2 Setup the Application Services Stack

1.  Use the latest version CloudFormation template and download it to your computer, alternatively you can by clone this repository: [200-ops-wordpress-fis.yaml](/Operations/200_Anticipate_failure_with_fault_injection_simulator/Code/200-ops-wordpress-fis.yaml) to create a WordPress site, with a provisioned RDS database, and pre-defined tag for Fault Injection Simulation experiemnt.

    In order to have better alignment to follow this workshop, it is recommened to use the App stack name as **WebApp1-Wordress**

2. Sign in to the AWS Management Console, select your preferred region, and open the CloudFormation console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/ . Note if your CloudFormation console does not look the same, you can enable the redesigned console by clicking New Console in the CloudFormation menu.

3. Click **Create Stack**, then **With new resources (standard)**.

4. Click **Upload a template file** and then click **Choose file**.

5. Choose the CloudFormation template you downloaded in [**Step 1.1**](#11-setup-the-vpc-stack), return to the CloudFormation console page and click Next.
Enter the following details:
Stack name: **WebApp1-WordPress**

6. Review the information for the stack. When youâ€™re satisfied with the configuration, check I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with custom names then click Create stack.

7. After the stack status changes to **CREATE_COMPLETE**, you can find the *WebsiteURL* value from *Outputs tab* in your web browser, this is how to access what you just created.
